I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at McMaster University, working under the supervision of [Professor Dr. Istvan David](https://istvandavid.com/). I am a member of the [Sustainable Systems and Methods (SSM) Lab](https://istvandavid.com/lab/#:~:text=ustainable%20Systems%20and%20Methods%20%28SSM%29%20Lab). My research focuses on artificial intelligence, digital twins, and sustainability.

I completed my Masterâ€™s Degree (MScAC) at the University of Toronto, and my Bachelor of Science at the University of British Columbia, where I developed a strong interest in machine learning and data science.
